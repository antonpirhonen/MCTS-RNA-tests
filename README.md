<h1>MCTS-RNA tests</h1>

This repository contains scripts to test the MCTS-RNA algorithm created by Yang, X., Yoshizoe, K., Taneda, A. & Tsuda, K. (2017) MCTS-RNA is a RNA inverse folding algorithm that uses Monte Carlo tree search to search the RNA sequence space for the RNA secondary structure given as a parameter. I use Python scripts to calculate the average and the median runtime with sequences of different length.

I should have forked the MCTS-RNA repository instead of cloning it. I will merge this repository into a fork later on.
